# HANDOFF — Gods of the Arena policy project (2026-09-14, 22:35 UTC)

## Where things stand
- **League:** `league_3c60897b-25cf-4b37-9d1a-8554c1198f28`, division `div_a4534073-c5d2-4193-a94a-93d9c5e2e443`.
  Player **Jordan** (`ply_bcb80069-fb0c-4ba5-a45c-06b647870aeb`), policy name `Jordan-ply_bcb80069-fb0c-4ba5-a45c-06b647870aeb`.
- **Champion (active, auto-champion on):** `Jordan:v17` = `policy/v19.bas`. Ladder: rank 5, 1536 MMR after 3 rounds (win rate 0.72). Aaron leads at 1662.
- **League coworld right now:** `cow_0752b441-af96-421d-8a1e-f8365a95e022` (2026.9.14.4, 116x116 map hash 6EB3A6B3). It changed three times today; verify with
  `uv run coworld xp-request get <xreq> --json` (fields coworld_id/coworld_version) before any local run. All tools already point at it.
- **Seating regime changed today (~21:00 UTC):** `settings.ladder.scheduler.distinct_teammates = true`. Each league episode seats ten different entrants,
  so this policy controls ONE hero (class fixed by seat: Red seat s -> class 5+s, Blue seat s -> class s) with four strangers. Everything built before
  that (five-clone stacks, tables below labelled "vs Aaron") was measured with five-clone rosters and no longer models the ladder.
- Auth: `uv run softmax status` (token already exchanged). Docker via OrbStack; always `export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64`.
- No local background tasks are running (stopped at handoff). Hosted XP requests may still be listed as completed under `uv run coworld xp-request list --mine`.

## Read first
1. `docs/ARENA_NOTES.md` — verified mechanics, map coordinates, host API, BASIC dialect gotchas, opponent habits, engineering lessons.
2. `README.md` — strategy log with every version and its measured result.
3. `policy/v19.bas` (champion) and `policy/v23.bas` (best solo-mode candidate). Both derive from v5 -> v8 (Codex lane switching) -> v9/v10 -> v12 -> v13 -> v16 -> v19.

## Measured results (hosted, both sides)
Five-clone rosters vs the #1 policy Aaron (`aaron-gota-ir-waveguard-r4:v2`): v10 27/36, v13 31/36, v16 34/36, v17 22/24, v19 45/48, v18 21/24, v20 21/24.
All strong versions beat every other ladder policy 36/36 in five-clone rosters.
Random rosters (my policy in seat 0 or 5, nine `{"random": true}` seats; models the new seating, very noisy, SE ~5-7%):
v19 61/96 (64%), v21 56/96 (58%), v22 25/48 (52%), v23 30/48 (62%; Blue 20/24, Red 10/24). Champion stays v19.
Caveat: those batches always used seats 0 and 5 (Death Knight / Vanguard Knight). Rotate seats 0-9 in future batches to cover all classes.

## Tooling
- `python3 tools/eval.py A.bas B.bas -n N --tag t [--clash]` — local five-clone A/B (RACE mirror lanes / CLASH both lane 2 / vs `policy/base.bas` / vs `policy/spar_turtle.bas`). File-locked, one at a time.
- `python3 tools/eval_mixed.py CAND.bas -n N` — local mixed-team proxy (candidate in seat 0 and 5, base.bas fillers). Weak proxy; base fillers just camp mid.
- `python3 tools/xp.py create <cand_ref> <opp_ref>... -n N --tag t` / `report xp/t.json` — hosted five-clone A/B. For random rosters see the inline snippets in git history (xp/*-mixed*.json were created with roster `{"random": true}` in nine seats; `report` works on them).
- `python3 tools/replay_parse.py FILE --summary | --timeline HERO_ID --every N` — parse hosted/local replays (game version 29 supported). Opponent lane habits came from this.
- `tools/probe.bas` dumps map/objects; `tools/mapcheck.py` validates waypoints on the decoded map (`docs/map_kinds.txt`).
- Codex workers: `docs/WORKER_BRIEF.md` + `docs/tasks/*.md`; launch with `node "$CC" task --background --fresh --write --model gpt-6-astra --effort xhigh`. They cannot run Docker, so the orchestrator runs all evals.
- Upload: `uv run coworld upload-policy --file policy/vNN.bas --tag version=vNN` (next label is `:v22`). Promote: `uv run coworld submit "<name>:vNN" -l <league> --auto-champion always --no-open-browser`.

## Policy design summary (v19 / v23)
- Map-generic: at tick 1 read own towers (ids 10+lane*6+team*3+tier) and fort; enemy positions = (mapWidth-1-x, mapHeight-1-y). Route = own gate->inner->outer, enemy outer->inner->gate, fort.
- Stack mode (allies >= 3 nearby at tick 360): Red pushes lane 2, Blue lane 0; focus fire lowest-HP enemy hero in range; footmen only when engaged or kill shots; fort-first when exposed; siege towers; lane switch when 3+ defenders hold a structure (cooldown 1500 ticks); boots first, then damage/HP items; kite ranged vs melee; potions at 55%; stuck recovery; hold-timeout; crippled-hero tower reset; home guard after respawn (v19).
- Solo mode (v21+, allies < 3 at tick 360): lane by seat parity; follow the friendly footman front; farm footmen; siege only with the wave or low towers; retreat when outnumbered (v22 hysteresis); v23 skips home guard and keeps the solo lane after respawn.

## Open ideas (not done)
1. Rotate seats in random-roster batches; compare v19 vs v23 at n >= 96 each per side before promoting anything.
2. Solo mode: choose the lane where the team already has allied heroes (help the group) vs. the empty lane; measure.
3. Defensive behaviour when the own fort is exposed; timeouts become possible in long mixed games.
4. buyItem is called every tick once thresholds are met (harmless but wasteful, ~800 calls/game).
5. STUCK recovery fires 7-26 times per game; better waypoints or smarter re-pathing could save time.
6. The forum/wiki have no entry from us yet; the coworld-version and seating changes are worth a forum note.
